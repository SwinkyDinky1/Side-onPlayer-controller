# Side-on Player-controller
[Side-on Player-controller](./Game/index.html) is the current name of a game I am working on.

## Features
So far, here are the features:
* ***Platform types***
  * **Normal**
      
      Just collides. Nothing special.
      
  * **Rocket**
      
      (300pts) Shoots you up in the air when you land on top of it. It disables collisions when it starts, then enables them again when you stop going up.
      
  * **Disappearing**
    
      Disappears when you stand on it. The longer you stand on it, the more it disappears until it's gone completely.
      
* ***Abilities***
  * **Double XP**
      
      (200pts) Self-explanatory.
      
* ***Settings***
  * **Show distance circle**
      
      Shows a line pointing to the nearest collision, and a circle it's length.
      
  * **Show full log**
      
      If on, watch out, because the full log fills up the entire left side of the screen. If off, it shows only the current score, the highscore, and the amount of usable points.
      
* ***Levels***
  * **Infinite**
      
      The main mode, you jump up infinitely randomly generated platforms.
      
  * **Debug**
      
      Every current type of platform.
      
  * **Jump**
      
      Pretty much just infinite stairs.
